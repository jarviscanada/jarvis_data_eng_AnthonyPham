      "description": "The Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent is a project that creates a method for monitoring data collected into SQL tables running on a containerized PostgreSQL platform. Through a virtual machine hosted on the google cloud platform, a docker container is created which hosts the Postgres database. The database is populated with hardware specifications of the active computer via various bash scripts after which several SQL queries can be run to check on the integrity of the data received. The process of data collection is automated by use of a crontab, and the job is set to collect a new piece of data every minute. The whole application is built and managed with Git and stored on a Github repository. To summarize the following technologies were used to build the project: Linux, CentOS, Docker, PostgreSQL, Bash, Git, Github, Google Cloud Platform, Crontab, Intellij",
