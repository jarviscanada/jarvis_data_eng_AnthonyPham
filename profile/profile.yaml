# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate from what is formerly Ryerson University, with a degree Computer Science. During my education I was able to learn the core concepts of computer science, specifically in the fields of software engineering, data mining, and database systems. I am currently a software developer at Jarvis Consulting Group where I am refining the fundamentals that I developed during my education, so that I may better integrate with a live working environment. At Jarvis I am actively employing  an agile workflow and broadening my technical horizons with various projects using technologies such as Docker, PostGreSQL amongst others.

    description: "The Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent is a project that creates a method for monitoring data collected into SQL tables running on a containerized PostgreSQL platform. Through a virtual machine hosted on the google cloud platform, a docker container is created which hosts the Postgres database. The database is populated with hardware specifications of the active computer via various bash scripts after which several SQL queries can be run to check on the integrity of the data received. The process of data collection is automated by use of a crontab, and the job is set to collect a new piece of data every minute. The whole application is built and managed with Git and stored on a Github repository. To summarize the following technologies were used to build the project: Linux, CentOS, Docker, PostgreSQL, Bash, Git, Github, Google Cloud Platform, Crontab, Intellij"
